# Hash Table

## Hashing

My hash function uses a prime factor of 101

## Collisions

I resolved collisions via separate chaining with my LinkedList. However, this could be considered cheating because the LinkedList relies on JavaScript's native Hash Table. In the future, I will attempt to resolve collisions via linear/quadratic probing or tupples.
