# Technical Questions

### Must Know

- [Data structures](../../ds/README.md)
- [Algorithms](../../algos/README.md)
- [Concepts](./concepts.md)

### Powers of 2 Table

### [Problem Solving Steps](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/uploads/6/5/2/8/6528028/cracking_the_coding_skills_-_v6.pdf)

1. Listen
   - Define **IOCE**: **I**nput, **O**utput, **C**onstraints, **E**dge Cases
   - Also ask about the story: what it is used for
2. Example
   - Analyze the examples provided, if any. If not, write some
   - Most examples are not representative of the whole problem
3. Brute Force
   - Without rushing, try to get past this step quickly
   - State a naive algorithm and its runtime
4. Optimize

   - **BUD**: **B**ottlenecks, **U**nnecessary work, **D**uplicatd work
   - Ask about any hidden info; or make use of unused info
   - Try solving by hand; then reverse engineering
   - Try walking through a failing test case
   -  BUD: Look for bottlenecks,
   -  DIY: Do It Yourself
   -  Simplify & Generalize:
   - Solve a simpler version.
   -  Base Case & Build: Solve for
     the base cases then build
     from there.
   - Data Structure Brainstorm:
   - Try various data structures.

5. Walkthrough
   - _Only start this step **AFTER** an optimal solution is found_
   - Act as the "interpreter", going line by line
   - Understand every detail
6. Implement
   - _Do **NOT** write any code before this step_, unless time is low
   - The goal is to write beautiful code
     - **Modularize** from the beginning
     - **Refactor** after to cleanup
   - Remember to talk through writing your code
7. Test
   - Almost there!
   - Conceptual test: walk through code like you are performing a detailed code review
   - Usual or nonstandard code?
   - Hotspots, like arithmetic and null nodes?
   - Use small test cases
   - Special cases / edge cases

### Misc

- If you can determine the **Best Case Runtime (BCR)**, then you will know when you have found a solution that is most optimal!
